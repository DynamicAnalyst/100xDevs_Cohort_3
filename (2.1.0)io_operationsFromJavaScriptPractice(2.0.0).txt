This file is being read from (2.1.0)

Hi my name is Arihant Jai Hansroy. This is the output from readFileSync, which is reading synchoronously.

readFile is asynchronous and for that some expanation from chatGpt

1. Synchronous (readFileSync) vs. Asynchronous (readFile)
	â€¢	fs.readFileSync() reads the file synchronously, meaning it blocks the execution until the file is fully read.
	â€¢	fs.readFile() reads the file asynchronously, meaning it does not block execution and requires a callback to handle the result.

2. fs.readFile Missing a Callback
	â€¢	The second function call (fs.readFile(...)) is missing a callback function. Since fs.readFile is asynchronous, it does not return the file contents directly like fs.readFileSync. Instead, it requires a callback to process the file contents.

--------------------------------------
Explanation:
	1.	For fs.readFileSync, it remains the same since it correctly reads the file synchronously.
	2.	For fs.readFile, a callback function is provided to handle the result:
	    â€¢	    If there is an error, it is logged using console.error().
	    â€¢	    If the file is read successfully, its contents are displayed.

Functional Arguments:-

The op parameter in the doOperation function is a callback function. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of how it works:

Step-by-Step Execution:
	1.	Defining Mathematical Functions:
	â€¢	sum(a, b) â†’ a + b
	â€¢	multiply(a, b) â†’ a * b
	â€¢	subtract(a, b) â†’ a - b
	â€¢	divide(a, b) â†’ a / b
	2.	doOperation Function:

function doOperation(a, b, op) {
    return op(a, b);
}

	â€¢	It takes three parameters: a, b, and op.
	â€¢	op is expected to be a function.
	â€¢	The function op is then executed inside doOperation using op(a, b).

	3.	Calling doOperation:

console.log(doOperation(1, 2, sum));

	â€¢	Here, sum (a function reference) is passed as the third argument.
	â€¢	This means op = sum.
	â€¢	When doOperation(1, 2, sum) runs, it effectively executes:

return sum(1, 2);  // which returns 1 + 2 = 3


	â€¢	The result (3) is logged to the console.

Key Concept: Function as a First-Class Citizen
	â€¢	In JavaScript, functions can be passed as arguments to other functions.
	â€¢	When doOperation is called, op is just a placeholder for the actual function (sum, multiply, etc.).
	â€¢	When op(a, b) is invoked inside doOperation, it executes the function that was passed.

Example with Different Operations:

console.log(doOperation(3, 4, multiply));  // 3 * 4 = 12
console.log(doOperation(10, 5, subtract)); // 10 - 5 = 5
console.log(doOperation(8, 2, divide));    // 8 / 2 = 4

Each function call executes the respective mathematical operation dynamically!

This is a common pattern in higher-order functions where you pass functions as arguments to achieve flexible and reusable code. ðŸš€

readFile simplified...



The readFile is basically .... 

function/callbackFunction functionName(err, data){      // (......basically saying if there is an error i will give error or if there not erro and data can be read then i will give data)
    console.log(data);
}

function readFile(filePath, encoding, function/callbackFunction){

}
